# NemVanityAddressGenerator 0.0.1
Generate a Nem.io address for either the mainnet or testnet that ends with your string.


## Command line switches (optional):
Use /S <string> to make the address end with your string

Eg.: /S kstr


Use /T to generate a testnet address


##Known issues:
Performance is on the low side.  The more characters your vanity string has, the more patient you will need to be.
